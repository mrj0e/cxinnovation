<h1 id="stakeholderinterviews">Stakeholder interviews</h1>

<p>For us to complete the project successfully we need to get under the skin of the company we are working with.
We immerse ourselves in their world understanding what makes the business tick. </p>

<p>The final outcome should be a picture of the business that we can use to help our client do the best work they possibly can and make sure our work gets signed off.</p>

<p>We are impartial, external mediators of business problems often expressed as poor design and an inability to deliver quality products. We need to understand the problems before we can design a solution. </p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<p>Primarily we want to understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>How the business operates</li>
<li>How business decisions get made</li>
<li>How the business measures value and success</li>
<li>The market the business operates in and competitors strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>How the idea we&#8217;re working in fits within the business</li>
<li>How the idea can make money or meet the organisation&#8217;s KPIs</li>
<li>Any blockers, that is, other projects, people initiatives that may effect the project</li>
</ul>

<p>Secondary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Map and understand team structures</li>
<li>Discuss sign-off approach</li>
<li>Design styles favoured</li>
<li>Any relevant documents like previous customer research, company org charts, processes, style guides, branding.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="theprocess">The process</h2>

<p>Discuss with the client contact that it’s often best if they are not present during the interviews. Often we get more candid answers if this is the case. Equally it saves them time. Be sensitive when discussing this, often the client contact will be nervous as they are responsible for the project and they might feel we’ll make them look bad!</p>

<p>Agree a list of stakeholders to interview, baring in mind that more will appear as we undertake the interviews.</p>

<p>Discuss the questions with the client contact. Don’t feel like you have to reveal all the questions as they may make the client contact uncomfortable. Use your judgement to decide what.</p>

<p>Arrange a time to speak to each person. Interviewing two stakeholders at the same time is good if they have similar job roles.</p>

<p>Interviews can take place on the phone, typically they take 20% less time as less is said. It’s not ideal but can help save time or make it easier if stakeholders are geographically separated.</p>

<p>Email the stakeholders to say what will happen. This is normally done by your contact, an example of the email they can send is in the document.</p>

<p>Take notes for each interview. If it’s appropriate record the conversation (of course getting permission to do so). Where possible use Pearnote. Make notes on a laptop, not in a book as it’ll take you ages to transfer.</p>

<p>Adapt the script between interviews to focus down on areas of interest or specific problems (eg IT never get anything built on time, why?).</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed all interviews share a summary.
Often it’s best to share just the headlines. Use your judgement around associating certain comments with certain stakeholders. Offering a summary of all interviews limits the ‘personal’ nature of many difficult subjects that might have been talked about.</p>

<p>Don’t share transcripts, recordings, records or notes of individual interviews where possible. Again the stakeholders are trusting us impartial, external mediators!</p>
